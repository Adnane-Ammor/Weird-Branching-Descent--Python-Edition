# Weird Branching Descent: Python Edition

> "we don't have the budget for graphics so pretend it's there"

**Weird Branching Descent** is a satirical, surreal text-based adventure game written in Python. Navigate through the bizarre stages of life, from birth to the high-stakes politics of the school playground, making questionable choices along the way.

## 🎮 Features

* **Branching Narrative:** Your choices affect the story (and who survives).
* **Dynamic Text:** Character interactions change based on your selected pronouns and family dynamics.
* **Input Validation:** Robust error handling ensures the game doesn't crash if you typo your way through life.
* **Graceful Exits:** Includes a custom `KeyboardInterrupt` handler for when you need to rage-quit (Ctrl+C).
* **ASCII Art:** State-of-the-art text graphics (budget pending).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your machine to play this game.
* **Python 3.x** (Tested on Python 3.10+)

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Adnane-Ammor/weird-branching-descent.git](https://github.com/Adnane-Ammor/weird-branching-descent.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
